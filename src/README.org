* purescript-language-corefn
Opinionated type definitions and serialization/deserialization for the PureScript CoreFn
representation in PureScript. This library is opinionated as in it doesn't provide a 1-to-1 mapping
of types from the canonical implementation; for example, tuples are replaced with records to provide
better metadata and reduce the size of the representation.
